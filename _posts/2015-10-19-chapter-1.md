April 21, 2114 (Saturday; Morning).

My "The History of Superpowered Humans" class have always bored me. I don't think it's because of Mr. Martinez- I don't have any problems with him on Advanced Psychology. It's not the ambiance either, since we are in one of the lecture halls at the top of the castle-like Lateran University. Mount Makiling should've been visible in the windows, if not for the storm clouds currently blocking it.

I looked to my right and noticed that my bestfriend Elle is also having some trouble focusing. The margins of her notebook are slowly filling up with doodles of snakes and flowers.

"What?" She whispered as she noticed that I was looking at her.

"I hoped that the storm would hit this morning." I whispered back.

"Yeah, the papers said that it should hit later today though.. maybe they'll suspend the afternoon classes?"

"I hope so"

Mr. Martinez continued to drone on, writing the names of superpowered heroes on the board. I already knew each one of them, even though I'm not a superhero geek. The media have always pushed the superpowered humans into the spotlight even before I was born.

The first column in the board was the six 9/11 responders: Meteo, Crossbones, Lancer, Powerhouse, and the twins, Psion and Psyker. They emerged when terrorists flew a couple of planes into a skyscraper in New York, more than a century ago. The footage have shown more than six heroes there, but none of the others have stepped forward.

The second column in the board has the names of members of the first recognized superpowered team. They assembled even before the modern superhero treaties of Tianjin or Glasgow. On the third column are several, less known superpowered humans: the first supervillains. And there's only one name in the last column, which Mr. Martinez is currently discussing right now.

"Batang-X. First registered in 2016 as the first Filipino superpowered human, in Tianjin. Still active today. Can anyone tell me what his known powers are?"

A girl in front of the class raised her hand. "Ms. Hernandez."

"Batang-X has two powers: he cannot age and he's real smart." She said as she stood up. "That's a Count-class Sphinx Level 2 and 3, respectively."

"Thank you. We will discuss power classifications later, but you are correct. Batang-X cannot age- unfortunately he also cannot improve his strength and stamina, as he is stuck at his current body. He is also a tactical genius, but he's not supernaturally gifted with intellect. His power only gives him peak-human intelligence on strategy and tactics."

Our professor moved on to discuss Batang-X's first superhero task force and his team. KIDlat, Control, 3-Na, and the others- some of them retired, two died in action and one missing. Of course, Batang-X's current team is now completely different. His task force right now has three vice-captains, each with their own team.

"Did you hear the news with Patrick last night?" Elle whispered. She is now doodling over her own notes, since her notebook's margins are full. "He got into another fight with Frank while at the Canteen."

Patrick and Frank are two of the seven superpowered students currently enrolled in Lateran. Both of them has some form of enhanced strength and endurance, which led into brawls more than several times. We actually don't know them much since they're a year above us, and are not Psychology students.

"Who won this time?"

"No one. Mr. Ramos was at the student center, which was close enough that he heard the two trading blows."

There's usually at least one professor in every major university who actually has powers. Lateran has two, and Sylvester Ramos (aka Shadowcage) was one of them. Mr. Ramos is our muscle-bound Gym Teacher, and he's also an officer in the Philippine Army Reserve. He always shows off his power at the first gym session of freshmen year. Mr. Ramos can create tendrils from his shadow: anyone touched by the tendrils are frozen in place. They can still see and hear, but cannot move or talk. He can take the entire class, superpowered or not, at a blink of an eye.

"Damn it. I was betting on Patrick this time." My nose is starting to itch as I replied.

"Yeah, I was too." Elle told me, and I noticed that she was actually writing this time. I looked to the board and saw that Mr. Martinez is now writing assignments for tomorrow. I quickly pulled my pen and notebook out from my bag and started to jot down notes as well. A quick glance on my phone says we're about 10 minutes before the class ends.

Elle continued. "I need to get some graphite for my next class, so I'm gonna have to sprint to the supply stores outside the campus. What's your next class, by the way? I know we both have 12 noon open for lunch."

I was about to say "Cognitive Psychology on 2nd Floor Annex", but instead I sneezed. Hard. Hard enough that I got white spots in my vision when I opened my eyes. As I recovered, I tried to get my handkerchief but instead found out that both of my hands are full. My right was still holding a pen, but my left was holding something small, square and thin.

The first thing that I noticed when my vision returned was that no one except Elle even looked towards me. Mr. Martinez is still explaining the assignments in the front of the class. The next thing I noticed was the three square sheets of graphite in my left hand. Lastly, I saw Elle with her mouth still open, and her pen pointing to the sheets in my hand.

"You've got superpowers." She finally whispered.
